# 📰 Fake News Detection App

A simple yet powerful **Fake News Detection** web app built using **Logistic Regression** and deployed with **Streamlit**.

## 🚀 Overview
The Fake News Detection App allows users to input any news article or paragraph and predicts whether the news is **Real** or **Fake**. It uses a pre-trained **Logistic Regression** model and text vectorization techniques (TF-IDF) to make predictions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python 🐍
- scikit-learn 🤖
- Streamlit 🌐
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## 💡 Features
- Real-time fake news classification
- TF-IDF based feature extraction
- Machine learning using Random Forest / Logistic Regression
- Deployed as a Streamlit web app
